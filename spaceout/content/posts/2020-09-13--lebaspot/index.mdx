## Lebaspot.com.pl is a bed and breakfast property located by the polish bałtyk sea.

This polish mini hotel, wanted to transfer most of the booking work online, therefore the owners of this property where not only interested in a nice and “sunny” design but also in its ablity to effectivly show them and visitors the free and reserved rooms for the whole time the property is working.
Landing page for Łebaspot, premium apartment and rooms for rent near the sea. Simple and minimalist layout with main focus on beautiful rooms and apartment photos. The design was mainly focused on projecting elegance and professionalism of this establishment. Website build upon next.js framework with custom CRM system for room reservation management.
##Deployment
Since most of hosting providers, are very accustomed to wordpress installations, there is no problem finding a reasonable hosting services for this kind of websites. In this case, I have recommended the same provider I using for this website; mydevil.net. Great service with ability to host your own node and ruby apps.
