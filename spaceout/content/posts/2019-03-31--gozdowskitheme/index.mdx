## Gozdowski theme, open source template for ghost.js  

One of my assiocates, Piotr Gozdowski, reporter, seo content writer and editor have approched me, to design a ghost.js template for his personal blog. He has agreed to open source this template to public. "Gozdowski theme", dark theme build upon the official casper template. You can check out his progress and theme at [https://gozdowskionline.pl](https://gozdowskionline.pl)

### Design

The original minimalistic casper theme was already build for reading. I have decided to go for the dark theme and change the typograghy for more "newspaper" fashion. I am very pleased with the final design, esspcially for mobile.  

### ghost.js

Ghost.js uses handlebarrs and .hbs files for its main template engine. It was quite a relaxing time going back to jquery based javascript. I will continue to improve the template and make sure its compatible with ongoing ghost platform development.
