## Nowa idea is a polish culture foundation, that focuses on social issues and promotion of Polish modern patriotic values.

### Gatsby.js

Ideanova.org.pl was built upon gatsby.js framework with a NetlifyCMS for managing and creating the content for the website. Gatsby.js websites come equipped with Proggressive Web Application support, which means that the site is using a service worker to store and cache website content on users' device, giving him the ability to view the website offline (upon returning visit).

PWA apps are also great for Lie Fi (seemingly good network, but actual slow download speeds).

### Netlify.

This site is deployed on the netlify service, which is a cloud based service for hosting modern apps.
Netlify is a great service, that helps to minimize the costs, provides free hosting up to 100 000 visits per month, with free SSL certificates, automatic deployment options and more of free digital stuff.
