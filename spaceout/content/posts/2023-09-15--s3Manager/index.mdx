# S3 Manager

Hi everyone, I'm excited to share with you a project I've been working on for
the last few months. It's a graphical user interface to aws s3 service, which
lets you easily manage your buckets, files and permissions. I have wrote it
using Rust lang in the backend and svelte for a frontend, and I want to tell you
how fun it was working with rust backend.

Rust is a systems programming language that focuses on performance, reliability
and concurrency. It has a powerful type system, memory safety guarantees and a
rich ecosystem of libraries and tools. Rust also has some unique features that
make it a great choice for backend development, such as:

- Ownership and borrowing: Rust uses these concepts to manage memory and
  resources without a garbage collector, avoiding runtime overhead and memory
  leaks.
- Traits and generics: Rust allows you to define abstract interfaces and
  implement them for different types, enabling code reuse and polymorphism.
- Async/await: Rust supports asynchronous programming with a built-in syntax
  that makes it easy to write concurrent code that is readable and efficient.
- Error handling: Rust has a robust and expressive way of dealing with errors,
  using the Result and Option types and the ? operator.

Using Rust for the backend of my GUI project was a rewarding experience. I
learned a lot about the language and its features, and I enjoyed the challenge
of writing fast and reliable code. I also used some awesome crates that made my
life easier, such as:

- Tokio: A runtime for writing async applications with Rust.
- Rusoto: A AWS SDK for Rust.
- Warp: A web framework that provides a simple and elegant way to create RESTful
  APIs.
- Sveltekit: A framework for building web applications with Svelte, a reactive
  frontend framework that compiles to vanilla JavaScript.

The result is a GUI application that is easy to use, responsive and
cross-platform. You can download it from my GitHub repository (link below) and
try it out yourself. I hope you find it useful and fun to use. If you have any
feedback or suggestions, please let me know in the comments. Thanks for reading!

## Installation files

[releases](https://github.com/MassivDash/S3_Manager/releases)

## Features

- Dark and light mode dependant on system preferences
- Files, Pictures, Movies and buckets gallery (grid style)
- Optimized for looking through the pictures / movies, lazy loading, images and
  movies streamed dritecly from the bucket, are loaded with presigned urls.
- Adjustable grid gallery
- Simple name search
- folders filtering in movies and images pages
- Tagging of assets
- Folder creation
- Multi file upload (drop files)
- Galleries remember scroll positions while navigating the app.

### AWS Account

In order to use the application you need aws account with s3 service activated.
S3 app uses standard aws config files used for aws cli connection
[info here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html).

```
~/.aws/credentials
```

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
aws_secret_access_key=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
```

```
~/.aws/config
```

```
[default]
region=us-west-2
output=json
```

### Alternate s3 endpoint

Set env vars `S3_CUSTOM_ENDPOINT` to `true` or `1` at your machine to alter the
s3 default endpoints Set the alternative endpoint url with
`S3_CUSTOM_ENDPOINT_URL` env

## Local install and development

Rust lang (cargo) and node.js (npm or yarn) and tauri-cli instalations are
needed to run / build the project from source

### Development

### Installing the Prerequisites

Project is build thanks to tauri app which uses RUST lang for the system portion
of the app and a custom html frontend, in order to start the project you need to
install following.

- Tauri app perquisites
  https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites
- Tauri app cli `cargo install tauri-cli`

### Architecture

This application is based on [tauri.app](https://tauri.app/), RUST lang in the
backend (core0 of the app and frontend things are handled by svelte + vite + ts
combo.

Simple division: Rust manages the data and the calls, front end displays the
data.

### Start

Since rust is responsible for making the aws calls you will need the rust
"backend" to be started, without it the app will not work. You will also need
need the aws credentials present on the system

```
cargo tauri dev
```

### Build

```
cargo tauri build
```

## Backend development

Rust has its own docs on each package
