# S3 Manager

Hi everyone, I'm excited to share with you a project I've been working on for
the last few months. It's a graphical user interface to aws s3 service, which
lets you easily manage your buckets, files and permissions. I have wrote it
using Rust lang in the backend and svelte for a frontend, and I want to tell you
how fun it was working with rust backend.

Rust is a systems programming language that focuses on performance, reliability
and concurrency. It has a powerful type system, memory safety guarantees and a
rich ecosystem of libraries and tools. Rust also has some unique features that
make it a great choice for backend development, such as:

- Ownership and borrowing: Rust uses these concepts to manage memory and
  resources without a garbage collector, avoiding runtime overhead and memory
  leaks.
- Traits and generics: Rust allows you to define abstract interfaces and
  implement them for different types, enabling code reuse and polymorphism.
- Async/await: Rust supports asynchronous programming with a built-in syntax
  that makes it easy to write concurrent code that is readable and efficient.
- Error handling: Rust has a robust and expressive way of dealing with errors,
  using the Result and Option types and the ? operator.

Using Rust for the backend of my GUI project was a rewarding experience. I
learned a lot about the language and its features, and I enjoyed the challenge
of writing fast and reliable code. I also used some awesome crates that made my
life easier, such as:

- Tokio: A runtime for writing async applications with Rust.
- Rusoto: A AWS SDK for Rust.
- Warp: A web framework that provides a simple and elegant way to create RESTful
  APIs.
- Sveltekit: A framework for building web applications with Svelte, a reactive
  frontend framework that compiles to vanilla JavaScript.

The result is a GUI application that is easy to use, responsive and
cross-platform. You can download it from my GitHub repository (link below) and
try it out yourself. I hope you find it useful and fun to use. If you have any
feedback or suggestions, please let me know in the comments. Thanks for reading!

## Installation files

[releases](https://github.com/MassivDash/S3_Manager/releases)

## Features

- Dark and light mode dependant on system preferences
- Files, Pictures, Movies and buckets gallery (grid style)
- Optimized for looking through the pictures / movies, lazy loading, images and
  movies streamed dritecly from the bucket, are loaded with presigned urls.
- Adjustable grid gallery
- Simple name search
- folders filtering in movies and images pages
- Tagging of assets
- Folder creation
- Multi file upload (drop files)
- Galleries remember scroll positions while navigating the app.

### AWS Account

In order to use the application you need aws account with s3 service activated.
S3 app uses standard aws config files used for aws cli connection
[info here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html).

```
~/.aws/credentials
```

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
aws_secret_access_key=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
```

```
~/.aws/config
```

```
[default]
region=us-west-2
output=json
```

### Alternate s3 endpoint

Set env vars `S3_CUSTOM_ENDPOINT` to `true` or `1` at your machine to alter the
s3 default endpoints Set the alternative endpoint url with
`S3_CUSTOM_ENDPOINT_URL` env

Rust lang (cargo) and node.js (npm or yarn) and tauri-cli instalations are
needed to run / build the project from source

This application is based on [tauri.app](https://tauri.app/), RUST lang in the
backend (core of the app and frontend things are handled by svelte + vite + ts
combo.

Simple division: Rust manages the data and the calls, front end displays the
data.
