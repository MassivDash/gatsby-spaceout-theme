### AWS Account

In order to use the application you need aws account with s3 service activated.
S3 app uses standard aws config files used for aws cli connection
[info here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html).

```
~/.aws/credentials
```

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
aws_secret_access_key=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
```

```
~/.aws/config
```

```
[default]
region=us-west-2
output=json
```

### Alternate s3 endpoint

Set env vars `S3_CUSTOM_ENDPOINT` to `true` or `1` at your machine to alter the
s3 default endpoints Set the alternative endpoint url with
`S3_CUSTOM_ENDPOINT_URL` env

## Local install and development

Rust lang (cargo) and node.js (npm or yarn) and tauri-cli instalations are
needed to run / build the project from source

### Development

### Installing the Prerequisites

Project is build thanks to tauri app which uses RUST lang for the system portion
of the app and a custom html frontend, in order to start the project you need to
install following.

- Tauri app perquisites
  https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites
- Tauri app cli `cargo install tauri-cli`

### Architecture

This application is based on [tauri.app](https://tauri.app/), RUST lang in the
backend (core0 of the app and frontend things are handled by svelte + vite + ts
combo.

Simple division: Rust manages the data and the calls, front end displays the
data.

### Start

Since rust is responsible for making the aws calls you will need the rust
"backend" to be started, without it the app will not work. You will also need
need the aws credentials present on the system

```
cargo tauri dev
```

### Build

```
cargo tauri build
```

## Backend development

Rust has its own docs on each package
