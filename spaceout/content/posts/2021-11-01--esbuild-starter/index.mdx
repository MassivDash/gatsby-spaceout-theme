# Esbuild template with typescript, react, and tailwindcss

React and Node.js template with esbuild, typescript, jest, testing libary, tailwind

React and Node.js and Typescript with only esbuild packages, starter is still experimental however fully functional. Since i opted to drop all webpack and webpack family related packages the process of hooking up some kind of live reload proved to be the most difficult to achieve. Project uses "servor" package, it has a longer booting time than webpack-dev-server

includes

- Server (express)
- Static React app with live reload
- Tailwind css (postCSS, Autoprefixer)
- Jest / react testing library
- Typescript
- Eslint, husky,
