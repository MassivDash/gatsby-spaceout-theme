This is one of spaceout.pl pro-bono works for activist group that operates in Warsaw.
Wolne miasto warszawa helps victims of illgal and unjust property reprivatasitation.

Custom wordpress installation was created as a platform for the activists to present thier ideas, and inform warsaw citizens about various justice and health important issues that trouble the great city of Warsaw.

As usual wordpress installation, a sturdy ox, provides everything one may need on the backend side of the application.

Good luck to all the memebers in their fight for better Warsaw.
