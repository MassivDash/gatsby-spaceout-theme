# Folders, files and the mayhem that comes with it

I will try to investigate the affects of folder structure on the DX (Developer
Experience) and how it can affects the project in the long run in terms of
structure, maintability and scabaility.

Each node or javasacript based project is a little diffent but we will do a deep
dive into structure of React Components, React Apps, Node.js on a example of
express.js and monorepo from a popular network next.js.

## Vintage point

Let's start with the most top view when entering the project. The root folder.
For many opening the project will be the starting point and can be a bit
overwhelming depending on the maturity of the project.

Lets a have a quick look at this monorepo node + react structue

<TreeChart folder={monoRepoJson} />

The monorepo shares a common node modules and uses webpack to build front and
back end. Front end is usually served via express.js as a static bundle but can
be easily altered to support partial and full server side rendering

## Miller's law

Miller's law states that the average number of objects an average human can hold
in working memory is 7 Â± 2. Knowing this limitation of the human brain, as
architects or main builders of application, we must make sure that the folder
structure of project follows logical strcuture, and what i think is the most
important, is that we must make sure that the structure is consistent, so our
fellow devs although not able to remember all the folders and files, can easily
navigate through the project.
