## Introduction

As a security and app developer enthusiast, I've been using Flipper Zero for
some time now. For those who don't know, Flipper Zero is a versatile multitool
device designed for hardware and RF enthusiasts, security researchers, and
hobbyists. It's a portable gadget that can interact with various digital systems
and wireless protocols.

Flipper Zero has a range of capabilities, including reading and emulating RFID
cards, interacting with NFC devices, transmitting and receiving radio signals,
and communicating with infrared devices. It features a compact design with a
monochrome display, navigation buttons, and an SD card slot for expandable
storage. The device runs on open-source firmware, which is one of its most
exciting aspects.

The cool thing about Flipper Zero is that you can write custom applications for
it, which is exactly what I've been trying to do. Recently, Flipper allowed Rust
language execution, and I jumped into the possibility of writing an application
in Rust for Flipper. However, I faced some challenges. The unsafe clusters and
the way Rust is built made it difficult for me to write the apps the way I
wanted.

That's why I decided to implement the same idea directly in C programming
language, often referred to as the father of all languages. These endeavors
ended up with the creation of Flipper Time Tracker.

Flipper Time Tracker is an application for the Flipper Zero device that allows
the user to track multiple tasks simultaneously. The application uses a CSV file
to store and handle task data, which can be easily exported to Excel or similar
software for further analysis. This approach also allows for tracking task time
in the background or even when the device is switched off!

## Features

- track multiple tasks at the same
- start / stop the task at will, resume tracking when needed.
- mark task as complete
- edit task details (name, description, price per hour)
- quick continue last used task
- task running with timer counter view
- you can download your csv file from `apps_data/trackerflipx/data.csv`

This project showcases the potential of Flipper Zero as a platform for custom
application development. The active community of developers and users who create
and share applications and modifications for Flipper Zero has been a great
source of inspiration and support throughout this project. It's exciting to see
how this compact device can be transformed into a practical tool for time
management and productivity.
