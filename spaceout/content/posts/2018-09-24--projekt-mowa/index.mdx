# Logopedy and radio speaking blog

This is gatsby.js blog designed fully by the spaceout.pl. Deployed via netlify service, with NetlifyCMS custom cms.

Slowly I am moving all of my new customers to gatsby.js and netlify platform, I think this is a great combination for blogers and company websites, that do need any crazy features. Netlify automatic deploment is very good for continous intergration, and on the other hand most of these websites will not cross the netlify 100 000 vistors per month free treshhold. 

No more servers, no more ssl costs, pure win for the client and me.
