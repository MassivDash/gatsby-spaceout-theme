##Lebaspot.pl is a bed and breakfast property located by the polish bałtyk sea. 

This polish mini hotel, wanted to transfer most of the booking work online, therefore the owners of this property where not only interested in a nice and “sunny” design but also in its ablity to effectivly show them and visitors the free and reserved rooms for the whole time the property is working.

##Wordpress
This website is based on Wordpress installation, since the owners were accustomed to its CMS system. 
Fitted with an original look and custom animations, shows the main abilities of wordpress framework: 
- reservation system 
- image gallery control
- ability to write posts and information updates for its customers without any help.

##Deployment
Since most of hosting providers, are very accustomed to wordpress installations, there is no problem finding a reasonable hosting services for this kind of websites. In this case, I have recommended the same provider I using for this website; mydevil.net. Great service with ability to host your own node and ruby apps.
