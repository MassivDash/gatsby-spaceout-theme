## Noc Niepodległości landing page

Polish independence night party is a social initiative that want to promote celebrating polish heritage in more mordern fashion. (well by parting hard...)

### Design

<video width="1150px" height="100%" autoplay muted style={{ margin: 'auto' }}>
  <source src="noc.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag
</video>
<p></p>

The approach for this design was to make a hybrid single page landing page with just a few side pages that would describe people and organisations which participate in this endavor. I always liked the idea of side dot naviagtion in website, it looks very clean and is quite functional in terms of User Expieriance. So i have decided to implent this kind of single page navigation. Slider with the participants at the bottom with short descriptions complete the website design and its used for side page navigation.

### Gatsby.js

React.js is my favorite UI libary for writing websites, and gatsby.js is a perfect framework to transfrom these skills into static sites that are extreamly fast. Website is build upon netlify CMS for the organisators to fill in the slider with more parties. Deplyed through netlify service, once again saves up costs for the client and gives me the ability to have automatic deployment proccess for faster development purposes.
