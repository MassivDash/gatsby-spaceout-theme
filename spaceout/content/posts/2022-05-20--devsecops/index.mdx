## Introduction

Around the year 2010 the Software Engineering had been transfomred by the
invention of [DevOps methology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps). Its main
focus was to bring the Developers (Dev) and server Admins (Ops) to close
cooperation in order to ensure that software products get a quick a steady
release.

DevOps changed the landscape of software creation by providing tools to automate
CI/CD pipelines, terraforming or maintaining server and network instances as a
code, procedures and protocols for automating unit and e2e testing. It also gave
us the role of DevOps Engineer, a fairly new position in the IT world, that
focuses on the tasks mentioned above.

## Enter DevSecOps

Small and big businesses have adopted quickly the DevOps methodology. In 2022
DevOps Engineers are essential IT personnel in delivering products / local
software instances to its online environments. As these practices became
standard, businesses have switched their focus from delivering fast to trying to
delivering fast but secure software.

Cyber crime is on the steady rise, data breaches, ransomware, phishing, supply
attacks, "evil competition" ddos attacks, social engineering attacks, the list
goes on and on. For more stats about cyber crime you can

In the past security teams were mostly reactive and not involved in the
development phase. Security specialists would focus on audits, reports and scans
on already made electronic products, then they would go back to dev teams or
product owners for remediation actions. This approach can be very problematic,
features or functions based on insecure solutions need time to be rewritten or
adjusted, sometimes already paid and delivered products need now additional work
in order to comply with security standards.

DevSecOps tries to remediate this problem, by involving the Security team in the
development process. Sometimes this is refereed to as "shifting left" in the
industry. This move tries to shift the responsibility of secure coding into the
developer domain by providing necessary tools and procedures to the DevOps
cycle.

## DevSecOps OWASP model

In my current position (Dec, 2022) as web application architect and team leader,
I have adopted the the DevSecOps model proposed by the OWASP organization
https://github.com/OWASP/DevSecOpsGuideline

The DevSecOps model helps in producing:

- automation to create short feedback loops to developers
- breaking down the silos between development, security, and operations
- breaking down security work into small pieces to create flow
- making decisions based on threat intelligence from operations
- establishing a culture of security experimentation and learning

## Threat Modeling
The first step in running a successful DevSecOps model is to do a threat analysis on the planned developed software.
