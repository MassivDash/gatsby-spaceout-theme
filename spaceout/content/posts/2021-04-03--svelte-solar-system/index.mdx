Svelte Solar System is yet another small app I have build while exploring and learning more about svelte framework.
This time I wanted to see how svelte will play with heavy css load and animations.
Simple yet very informative app, made in mind for people that are hungry for that "space" knowledge

The results can be seen at  [https://solar.spaceout.pl](https://solar.spaceout.pl), repo for the project as usually on [Github](https://github.com/MassivDash/svelte-solar-system)

<video width="1150px" height="100%" autoplay muted style={{ margin: 'auto' }}>
  <source src="solar.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag
</video>

The results are very pleasing, it shows that svelte is a great framework for building small, fast and responsive web apps. Definetly way to go on the small application side.
