Svelte Solar System is yet another small app I have build while exploring and learning more about svelte framework.
This time I wanted to see how svelte will play with heavy css load and animations.
Simple yet very informative app, made in mind for people that are hungry for that "space" knowledge

The results can be seen at [here](https://solar.spaceout.pl), repo for the project as usually on [Github](https://github.com/MassivDash/svelte-solar-system)
