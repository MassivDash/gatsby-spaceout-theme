## Introduction

In recent times I have decided to start learing a new programming language. Out
of all the possibilities I have found Rust to be the most suitable. Rust is a
safe, fast, and memory safe language for writing software, I see a lot of
potential in Rust esspeciall in building software for future IoT devices. Rust
is also a heavily typed proggraming language which makes it easy to write code
that is more readable and easy to debug.

I have embarked on a mission to build something useful with it, the idea for
rewritting my previous optimization intercative cli build with typescript to
rust came as an obvious choice for me.

## Cargo-imagermachine

**Rust cli for batch optimizing images**

Cargo-imagermachine was designed as a subtool of cargo package manger, so user
can run the interactive cli from the command line inside folders that contain
pictures.

Imagermachine uses turbo-jpeg library for jpeg files optimization and oxi png
for png images. You must install the turbo-jpeg yourself as the cli uses only
the bindings to the turbo-jpeg library. Installation guide for respective
systems below.

Imagermachine can:

- Optimize png and jpg images.
- Resize and crop images.
- Rename the transformed files based on provided*name*(index).ext
- Convert files to Webp
- todo: set optimalisation custom config

### Dependencies

So far the cli has been tested on unix systems (Debian, Mac).  
Before using cargo-imagermachine you must install

#### Rust

Follow the official guideline for installing rust on your system
https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

#### Libturbojpeg

Offical webiste and documentation üëâ https://www.libjpeg-turbo.org/

_Debian_

```bash
sudo apt-get install libturbojpeg libturbojpeg0-dev
```

This should be enough to get started on Ubuntu

_Mac_

```bash
brew install jpeg-turbo
```

! Remember to copy all the export paths that brew will print out after
installation, I am using the following config in the cargo.toml file, pkg-config
(also via brew) installation is needed for this setup to work.

```yml
turbojpeg = {version = "0.4", features = ["image", "pkg-config"]}
```

If you have troubles linking the cli to your libturbo, you can try to edit the
cargo.toml file and add feature flags into turbojpeg features array, for more
reference follow this
[link](https://github.com/honzasp/rust-turbojpeg#requirements).

### Install

In order to install cargo-imagermachine on your computer, clone the project then
run the following command from the project folder:

```sh
cargo install --path .
```

### Usage

If you followed the offical rust documentation and cargo / rustc is in scope,
navigate to a input folder and run

```sh
cargo imagermachine
```

Follow directions on the interactive cli to optimize, resize, rename the images.
