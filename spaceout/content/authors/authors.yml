  bio: |
    Hello everybody ðŸ‘‹ !  My name is Luke and I am the creator and owner of the spaceout.pl. Personally, I am a big geek with huge love for Star Wars, Marvel and DC comic books, Funk and 80s music. I take most of my design inspiration from offline experiences like going to art museums, galleries and working with other creative people on various projects. I also work with various Activist and NGO groups as a pro-bono designer and developer.
