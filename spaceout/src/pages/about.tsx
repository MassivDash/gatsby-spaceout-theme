              I have built my first website way back in highschool (2004), and
              since then I have been perfecting my skills in both design, (UX,
              UI) and web/app development.

              For many years now, I have been involved in various projects as a
              systems architect and UI/UX consultant. I make sure that various
              designs and ideas can be implemented swiftly and without headache
              to all major platforms (such as AWS services, Azure, custom
              Virtual and dedicated servers,). My area of expertise is React.js
              and React Native, Node.js, which I use to develop Apps for all the
              major platforms (Web, iOS and Android).

              I am a big geek with huge love for Star Wars, Marvel and DC comic
              books, Funk and 80s music. I take most of my design inspiration
              from offline experiences like going to art museums, galleries and
              working with other creative people on various projects. I also
              work with various Activist and NGO groups as a pro-bono designer
              and developer.
